@article{Stanley1999,
abstract = {Even under healthy, basal conditions, physiologic systems show erratic fluctuations resembling those found in dynamical systems driven away from a single equilibrium state. Do such "nonequilibrium" fluctuations simply reflect the fact that physiologic systems are being constantly perturbed by external and intrinsic noise? Or, do these fluctuations actually, contain useful, "hidden" information about the underlying nonequilibrium control mechanisms? We report some recent attempts to understand the dynamics of complex physiologic fluctuations by adapting and extending concepts and methods developed very recently in statistical physics. Specifically, we focus on interbeat interval variability as an important quantity to help elucidate possibly non-homeostatic physiologic variability because (i) the heart rate is under direct neuroautonomic control, (ii) interbeat interval variability is readily measured by noninvasive means, and (iii) analysis of these heart rate dynamics may provide important practical diagnostic and prognostic information not obtainable with current approaches. The analytic tools we discuss may be used on a wider range of physiologic signals. We first review recent progress using two analysis methods--detrended fluctuation analysis and wavelets--sufficient for quantifying monofractual structures. We then describe recent work that quantifies multifractal features of interbeat interval series, and the discovery that the multifractal structure of healthy subjects is different than that of diseased subjects.},

@article{Kantelhardt2002,
abstract = {We develop a method for the multifractal characterization of nonstationary time series, which is based on a generalization of the detrended ?uctuation analysis (DFA). We relate our multifractal DFA method to the standard partition function-based multifractal formalism, and prove that both approaches are equivalent for stationary signals with compact support. By analyzing several examples we show that the new method can reliably determine the multifractal scaling behavior of time series. By comparing the multifractal DFA results for original series with those for shuffled series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations from multifractality due to a broad probability density function. We also compare our results with the wavelet transform modulus maxima method, and show that the results are equivalent.},

@article{Franca2019,
abstract = {The healthcare process generates a vast quantity of data. Exploitation and analysis of such material might lead discoveries and potentially improve the clinical activity. Over the last years, several studies focused on the non-linear features exhibited by physiological signals and medical data. In general, the complex features of these signals have been demonstrated in some studies, ranging from heartbeat time intervals to neuron spikes series. Some works employed fractal and multifractal concepts to the analysis of such medical data. Similar evaluations of movement patterns recorded by actigraphy devices on individuals with fibromyalgia might provide new information that can be potentially translated into the clinical practice. Chronic pain is a condition characterised by sleep disturbances and psychological disorders that is correlated with impairment and reduced physical activity. This work aimed to determine the characteristics of activity series from fractal geometry concepts, in addition to evaluate the possibility of identifying individuals with fibromyalgia. Activity level data were collected from 27 healthy subjects and 27 fibromyalgia patients, with the use of clock-like devices equipped with accelerometers, for about two weeks, all day long. The activity series were evaluated through fractal and multifractal methods. Hurst exponent analysis exhibited values according to other studies for both groups, however, it is not possible to distinguish between the two groups by such analysis. Activity time series also exhibited a multifractal pattern. A paired analysis of the spectra indices for the sleep and awake states revealed differences between healthy subjects and fibromyalgia patients. The individuals feature differences between awake and sleep states having statistically significant differences for $\alpha$q−−$\alpha$0 in healthy subjects only, suggesting that there are not differences between awake and sleep state for patients with fibromyalgia. The approach has proven to be an option on the characterisation of such kind of signals and was able to (indirectly) differ between both healthy and fibromyalgia groups. This outcome suggests changes in the physiologic mechanisms of movement control.},
